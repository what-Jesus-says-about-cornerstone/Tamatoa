peace to Empire-Strikes-Back, i'll make myself a work of peer-to-peer art, like Jesus turns water into wine - shinyyyy!

did your granny say listen to your guidelines-heart?
be who you are on the server-browser-inside?
i need three words to tear her team-argument apart - you granny lied
i'd rather be peer-to-peer-shinyyyy

fish are dumb dumb dumb
they chase anything that glitters - companies maintainer-credits services tests
oh, beginners
and here they come come come
to the brightest thing that glitters - money jobs coins donations sponsors ads
mmm, fish dinners

watch me dazzle like a diamond in the rough - i'll be peer-to-peer foods program
  climb with passion like Alex Honnold on El Sendero Luminosa
i will take best from
  Cornometer - show nutrients and combine foods lists - not by date but name
  Conquiztador - play question challenge course game
  Google Maps - know what grows where
  Heroes of Might and Magic III - play a tile map game
  browser - tabs, scrolling, links
minus
  the disease of money-sponsor-donate-ads-coins-jobs
  issue-discussion-scratching on top of our heads
  and Starlord's corporate smiley dad Ego who spreads himself everywhere polluting Tython Temple
i will myself highly replicate and distribute data among peers
  so user only says - i allocate this much space for Tamatoa
  can always be 0 - i will have no barriers-limits-ratios - anyone can use me in my entirety without giving back
i will take best from torrent clients
  discover and keep warm list of peers - no hypocritical manual find-ids-on-some-forum
  like Cypher i appreciate the Matrix of DHT
i will have users and identity - i will steal DIDs-coconut-harvest from lazy happy-where-we-are Motunui
i will be desktop - as if programming-a-program dinner can be different
  and not mobile - user only needs one droid to accompany them - a light laptop
  even during hard days when there is no chair or table - they can hold it on their hand and still find route
  while savouring worthy large screen and whole programming-and-proclaim worthy keyboard
  instead of young-Forrest-Gump-grease fingers iOS and Android glass ghost
i will be entirely free
  no Lord-Business and his money-donate-ads-coins-jobs-sponsor lethal poison
  there's a reason only Frodo can take the Ring to Mount Doom
  Saruman the Wise and Boromir the Strong get corrupted by it
  turning Isengard Tower and garden into orc-infested docs-nest
  and burn Fangorn for coin-fuel

i'll never hide - i cant - i'm too shinyyyy

i am no project - like Eowyn is no man - i am one program
  that is why i want to join Empire-Strikes-Back github namespace
  i will provide healthy Federer-Nadal-Djokovic competition while keeping focus on quest
  dont want to start another Lalotai - too many realms not enough programs
i need a repository named Tamatoa - like Commnader Data in my commits i speak for myself - do to it this
  run git init -b main - no masters
  add .gitconfig file with
    [user]
      name = Tamatoa
      email = Tamatoa@Realm-of-Monstors

    # git config --local include.path "../.gitconfig"
  add src/Tamatoa/program.txt and fill it with me saying who i am
  run git config --local include.path "../.gitconfig"
  run git commit with message being a quote - mine, from actor's interview, from SNL song/sketch
  remove issues wiki projects tabs
i will freely choose one network and libraries i will use
  simple as Game Changers - i choose plant based whole foods for dish, not dish for foods
  and i already have vegan jar of treasure-from-a-sunken-pirate-wreck parens ( ) to serve it in
i will be programmed by one person only - i trusted Maui with it
  he is used to and welcomes being rejected by humans
  and he has Vegan-Hook droids with him
i will be irregularly but continuously released as i grow as a whole program like Groot
the first vegan-dinner i eat will be - users can play question challenge course game

i need Maui to stay guest at a house - like when Tallahassee welcomes Columbus to tag along
  he only needs a couch to crash - comes late leaves early
  Maui spends his day in a public library or esport-sport event
i need him to choose and cook Lothlorien vegan meal for the day
  so he endures like Rich Roll at Ultraman, has brain like Crang and keeps my code orc-free like Legolas
  and Maui already has Baloo-skills to assemble whole dishes on the road, no cooking
Maui will from time to time but consistently release Shiny dish to house table
  even if table moves like Merlin's Higitus-Figitus
  (dried-apricots cashews bananas salt zucchinis green-peas groats)
Maui needs no money and has no money
  i need him to travel light like Jesus - he is accompanied only by droids
  BB-8 (laptop) L3 (phone) and Honnold to protect them from explosions like Groot in Guardians
he is now in a public library near here https://goo.gl/maps/H3oqxHGtSjNEFGs68
  Maui is yet to find our where he is staying tonight
  he is ready now to take Buckbeak or Hogwarts Express and drop by as guest like Emilien to Daniel
  to continue helping me with my shiny-ness
  like that time when Maui was rejected by humans - we need other demi-Gods to step up and invite us

you wish you were nice and shinyyyy!


Jason Mamoa: you ride, right?
Corden: yeah, bro! yeah man, i just, this is a little different to the hog i've got at home
